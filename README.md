**Dungeon Explorer** is a console-based adventure game where the player explores rooms in a dungeon, battles monsters, collects treasures, and solves puzzles to progress.

The game will likely eventually feature:
A main game loop handling user input and game state.
Multiple classes representing characters, items, rooms, and the dungeon itself.
Inheritance to share behavior between players and monsters.
Collections (arrays/ArrayLists) to manage inventory, enemy lists, and dungeon layouts.
Basic file I/O to save and load game progress (extra maybe).
Exception handling to manage invalid inputs and unexpected situations.
